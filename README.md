# Background

I'm Jules, a generalist software developer upholding the ethos of 'Software as a Craft'.

Learning and improving are my drives, so the ever-changing tech industry suits me right down to the ground, along with the teamwork, planning, and problem-solving that comes with it.

I know from broad experience teaching, working with musicians, and pair-programming that I work best when I've got others to bounce ideas off of, but also appreciate having the odd bit of time to work alone.

# Skills

#### Collaborator

When it comes to working with others, I'm always malleable to the goals of the team, while extracting personal value as it comes.

- As a consultant at 8th Light, collaborating with colleagues and client developers is important for knowledge sharing, upskilling, and achieving meaningful goals
- During my time at Makers, I pair-programmed every day, and I know that two programmers collaborating always result in better output

#### Communicator

My specialty is making things easy to understand.

I took advantage of the many opportunities presented at university to develop my skills for my previous job as an ESL English teacher. Being a committee member and conductor of the Brunel Film Orchestra & Choir Society provided vital practise in managing large groups, and working with small, goal-oriented groups.

Having played in orchestras from a young age, I've also developed a strong sense of the oft neglected part of communication, which is being receptive to what others try to communicate. This capacity proved vital when teaching English to students from a huge range of ages and abilities, as there's a much greater degree of projecting ideas when unsure of the exact terminology.

Accessibility is key, and before I brought foreign cultures and abstract concepts to students in a second language, I worked with native English speakers, breaking down my understanding of topics to help students with learning difficulties.

# Education

#### Makers Academy (January 2019 - April 2019)

- Primarily worked in Ruby and JavaScript, also used Python and Java in projects.
- Tried various pair-programming styles, and found that having someone else to bounce ideas off in real time has a strong positive impact on my code.
- Complete convert to TDD and Agile.

- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, Python
- RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine, Pytest

#### Brunel University London (September 2012 - July 2015)

- Achieved a 2:1 with Honours in Music Composition (BMus)
- Treasurer, Arranger, and Conductor of Brunel's Film Orchestra & Choir Society
- Conducted, played, and sang at a range of concerts with a range of groups.

# Interests

My goal every day is to be just a bit better than I was yesterday; I crave that feeling of something that I didn't understand 'clicking', and knowing that I've pushed myself. Or to play some frankly weird computer games.

- Olympic Weightlifting
- A slow-burning interest in poker
- Games, particularly Resource Management, Dystopian, and those with fun narratives
- Home brewing beer and wine
